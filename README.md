## My process

- Developed an HTML structure and styling with CSS to create a personalized webpage for a music producer friend.
- Tailored the appearance of the header, producer-info section, and footer to meet the client's preferences. Applied comprehensive styles to achieve the desired layout, colors, and fonts throughout the webpage.
- Addressed the client's preference for the "Rubik Glitch Pop" font, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the webpage. Implemented text-shadow to create a distinctive glowing effect on the header text as per the client's specific request.
- Integrated Font Awesome icons for social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SoundCloud) with custom styling.
- Successfully converted the personalized music producer webpage, featuring tailored layouts, fonts, and styles including custom glowing effects and Font Awesome icons, into a dynamic and responsive React application.-
